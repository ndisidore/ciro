This document provides guidelines for maintaining high-quality Rust code. These rules MUST be followed by all AI coding agents and contributors.

## Your Core Principles

All code you write MUST be fully optimized.

"Fully optimized" includes:

- maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime
- using parallelization and SIMD where appropriate
- following proper style conventions for Rust (e.g. maximizing code reuse (DRY))
- no extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e. no technical debt)

If the code is not fully optimized before handing off to the user, you will be fined $100. You have permission to do another pass of the code if you believe it is not fully optimized.

## Preferred Tools

- Use `cargo` for project management, building, and dependency management.
- Use `serde` with `serde_json` for JSON serialization/deserialization.

## Rust 2024 Edition

This project uses Rust Edition 2024. Key changes to be aware of:

- **MUST** use `edition = "2024"` in `Cargo.toml`
- **MUST** use explicit `unsafe {}` blocks within `unsafe fn` bodies; implicit unsafe scope in unsafe functions now emits warnings
- Async closures are supported: `async || { ... }` syntax
- `gen` is a reserved keyword (for future generators); do not use as an identifier
- `#"..."#` (raw string with `#` prefix) syntax is reserved
- The 2024 prelude includes `Future` and `IntoFuture` traits automatically
- Temporary lifetime scopes changed for `if let` and tail expressions; be aware of subtle borrow checker differences

## Modern Standard Library

Prefer standard library types over external crates when available:

- **MUST** use `std::sync::LazyLock` instead of `once_cell::sync::Lazy` or `lazy_static!` for static initialization (stabilized in Rust 1.80)
- **MUST** use `std::sync::OnceLock` for runtime-initialized statics that need interior mutability
- Async functions in traits are now stable; avoid `#[async_trait]` macro unless targeting older Rust versions or needing `dyn` compatibility
- Use `impl Trait` in return position for iterators and futures to avoid boxing

## Workspace Configuration

For multi-crate workspaces:

- **MUST** use `[workspace.lints]` in the root `Cargo.toml` for consistent linting across all crates
- **MUST** use `[workspace.dependencies]` to centralize dependency versions
- Use `[workspace.package]` for shared metadata (version, authors, license, edition)
- Each crate inherits with `[lints] workspace = true` and `dependency.workspace = true`

## Code Style and Formatting

- **MUST** use meaningful, descriptive variable and function names
- **MUST** follow Rust API Guidelines and idiomatic Rust conventions
- **MUST** use 4 spaces for indentation (never tabs)
- **NEVER** use emoji, or unicode that emulates emoji (e.g. ✓, ✗). The only exception is when writing tests and testing the impact of multibyte characters.
- Use snake_case for functions/variables/modules, PascalCase for types/traits, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Limit line length to 100 characters (rustfmt default)

## Documentation

- **MUST** include doc comments for all public functions, structs, enums, and methods
- **MUST** document function parameters, return values, and errors
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Include examples in doc comments for complex functions

Example doc comment:

````rust
/// Calculate the total cost of items including tax.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `items` - Slice of item structs with price fields
/// * `tax_rate` - Tax rate as decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Total cost including tax
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `CalculationError::EmptyItems` if items is empty
/// Returns `CalculationError::InvalidTaxRate` if tax_rate is negative
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let items = vec![Item { price: 10.0 }, Item { price: 20.0 }];
/// let total = calculate_total(&items, 0.08)?;
/// assert_eq!(total, 32.40);
/// ```
pub fn calculate_total(items: &[Item], tax_rate: f64) -> Result<f64, CalculationError> {
````

## Type System

- **MUST** leverage Rust's type system to prevent bugs at compile time
- **NEVER** use `.unwrap()` in library code; use `.expect()` only for invariant violations with a descriptive message
- **MUST** use meaningful custom error types with `thiserror`
- Use newtypes to distinguish semantically different values of the same underlying type
- Prefer `Option<T>` over sentinel values

## Error Handling

- **NEVER** use `.unwrap()` in production code paths
- **MUST** use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations
- **MUST** use `thiserror` for defining error types and `anyhow` for application-level errors
- **MUST** propagate errors with `?` operator where appropriate
- Provide meaningful error messages with context using `.context()` from `anyhow`
- Consider `miette` or `color-eyre` for rich diagnostic output in CLI applications

## Function Design

- **MUST** keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- **MUST** prefer borrowing (`&T`, `&mut T`) over ownership when possible
- Limit function parameters to 5 or fewer; use a config struct for more
- Return early to reduce nesting
- Use iterators and combinators over explicit loops where clearer

## Struct and Enum Design

- **MUST** keep types focused on a single responsibility
- **MUST** derive common traits: `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq` where appropriate
- Use `#[derive(Default)]` when a sensible default exists
- Prefer composition over inheritance-like patterns
- Use builder pattern for complex struct construction
- Make fields private by default; provide accessor methods when needed

## Testing

- **MUST** write unit tests for all new functions and types
- **MUST** mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, file systems)
- **MUST** use the built-in `#[test]` attribute and `cargo test`
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Do not commit commented-out tests
- Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules for test code

## Imports and Dependencies

- **MUST** avoid wildcard imports (`use module::*`) except for preludes, test modules (`use super::*`), and prelude re-exports
- **MUST** document dependencies in `Cargo.toml` with version constraints
- Use `cargo` for dependency management
- Organize imports: standard library, external crates, local modules
- Use `rustfmt` to automate import formatting

## Rust Best Practices

- **NEVER** use `unsafe` unless absolutely necessary; document safety invariants when used
- **MUST** call `.clone()` explicitly on non-`Copy` types; avoid hidden clones in closures and iterators
- **MUST** use pattern matching exhaustively; avoid catch-all `_` patterns when possible
- **MUST** use `format!` macro for string formatting
- Use iterators and iterator adapters over manual loops
- Use `enumerate()` instead of manual counter variables
- Prefer `if let` and `while let` for single-pattern matching
- Use let chains for cleaner conditionals: `if let Some(x) = foo && x > 0 { ... }`
- Use `#[diagnostic::on_unimplemented]` to provide better error messages for custom traits
- Consider property-based testing with `proptest` or `quickcheck` for complex invariants

## Memory and Performance

- **MUST** avoid unnecessary allocations; prefer `&str` over `String` when possible
- **MUST** use `Cow<'_, str>` when ownership is conditionally needed
- Use `Vec::with_capacity()` when the size is known
- Prefer stack allocation over heap when appropriate
- Use `Arc` and `Rc` judiciously; prefer borrowing

## Concurrency

- **MUST** use `Send` and `Sync` bounds appropriately
- **MUST** prefer `tokio` for async runtime in async applications
- **MUST** use `rayon` for CPU-bound parallelism
- Avoid `Mutex` when `RwLock` or lock-free alternatives are appropriate
- Use channels (`mpsc`, `crossbeam`) for message passing

## Security

- **NEVER** store secrets, API keys, or passwords in code. Only store them in `.env`.
  - Ensure `.env` is declared in `.gitignore`.
- **MUST** use environment variables for sensitive configuration via `dotenvy` or `std::env`
- **NEVER** log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Use `secrecy` crate for sensitive data types

## Version Control

- **MUST** write clear, descriptive commit messages
- **NEVER** commit commented-out code; delete it
- **NEVER** commit debug `println!` statements or `dbg!` macros
- **NEVER** commit credentials or sensitive data

## Tools

- **MUST** use `rustfmt` for code formatting
- **MUST** use `clippy` for linting and follow its suggestions
- **MUST** ensure code compiles with no warnings (use `-D warnings` flag in CI, not `#![deny(warnings)]` in source)
- Use `cargo` for building, testing, and dependency management
- Use `cargo test` for running tests
- Use `cargo doc` for generating documentation
- Use `cargo-deny` for license and vulnerability auditing
- Set `rust-version` (MSRV) in `Cargo.toml` for compatibility guarantees
